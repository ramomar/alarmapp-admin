## Credentials

Since this is a personal project, I decided to hardcode tokens in files in order to avoid hosting a backend app (tokens are easily resetable if a device gets compromised ðŸ˜›).

You must set your own credentials in the following files: `src/config.json` and `sentry.properties`.

| Credential | Description | File |
|------------|-------------|------|
| PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN | Your access token to the Particle Cloud API. | `src/config.json` |
| PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID | The ID of your Particle Photon. | `src/config.json` |
| SENTRY_DSN | DSN provided by Sentry. | `src/config.json` |
| auth.token | Access token provided by Sentry. | `sentry.properties`|
## Deploying to devices

Run `ionic cordova run android` or `ionic cordova run ios`.
